# Association Analysis
In this project, we implement Apriori and FP-growth,
two association analysis algorithms, from scatch.

## Build
It is a project generated by VS2017. So, it is easy to build if you have VS2017.
Otherwise, try compiling all the cpp files in the `AssociationAnalysis` folder
by the C++11 standard.

## Interfaces
All the interfaces for association analysis are defined in `AssociationAnalysis.h`.
There are two parts:
- DataLoader, which defines the interfaces to load data for association analysis alogrithms.
- Association analysis alogrithms, which include `Apriori` and `FPGrowth`.

## Dataset
We have three datasets, and each of them can be loaded
by the class that implements the DataLoader class.
For further infomation, see `AssociationAnalysis/dataset/<dateset-name>/README`.
